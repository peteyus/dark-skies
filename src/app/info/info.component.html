<p>There are many different ways to measure light pollution, but a common standard is required to allow for measurement and discussion about the state of the sky in different locations. One such method is the <a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/light-pollution-and-astronomy-the-bortle-dark-sky-scale/?c=y">Bortle scale</a>, described by John Bortle in terms of what stars and astronomical features are visible and widely accepted by astrophotographers.</p>
<p>Here, thanks to <a href="https://astrotelescopium.com/blogs/news/how-to-use-the-bortle-scale-for-choosing-the-best-stargazing-locations">AstroTelescopium</a>, you can see an example of the same sky across the Bortle scale, and can see how more and more of the night sky is washed out by city lights.</p>

<p><strong>Light pollution isn't a forever problem.</strong> Through the efforts of communities and cities, regulation can be applied to reverse light pollution and bring the night sky back. This has benefits for tourism and can be done without comporomising safety. The city of Flagstaff, Arizona has a Bortle rating of 4 thanks to the efforts of its <a href="https://flagstaffdarkskies.org/">Dark Skies Coalition</a>, making it a great location for seeing the stars. The Lowell Observatory, known for its role in the discovery of Pluto, is located just outside of downtown Flagstaff. </p>
<p><strong>How can I help?</strong> Many areas already <em>have</em> regulations about light pollution, but are poorly enforced. Learn what the regulations are in your city, town or county and see what you can do to ensure your home follows them. Attend local city council meetings and request enforcement of lighting standards be on the agenda. Contact city/county/state representatives and let them know this is an important educational resource that's available to the public for free, all it takes is the political will to set and maintain standards for lighting at night. Through persistence and participation, we can restore the wonder of the night sky, and the 80% of Americans who have never noticed the Milky Way can see what there was for the ancients to tell stories about.</p>
<p>There are many tools for helping us see the extent of light pollution today, including this <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=5.30&lat=39.9479&lon=-110.4922&state=eyJiYXNlbWFwIjoiTGF5ZXJCaW5nUm9hZCIsIm92ZXJsYXkiOiJ3YV8yMDE1Iiwib3ZlcmxheWNvbG9yIjpmYWxzZSwib3ZlcmxheW9wYWNpdHkiOiI2MCIsImZlYXR1cmVzb3BhY2l0eSI6Ijg1In0=">light pollution map</a>. Tools like this track progress and help people find great locations for seeing the night sky, and is where I've pulled ratings from for the examples on the <a routerLink="/stars">stars</a> page.</p>
