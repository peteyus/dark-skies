# DarkSkies

This project is an adaptation of a research paper on dark skies regulation. When running, it acts as a simulator of light pollution, to show how changing levels of light affect the visibiltiy of stars. Images of various constellations are credited to [Stellarium](https://www.stellarium-labs.com/stellarium-mobile-plus/).
